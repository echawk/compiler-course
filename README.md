# Compilers

This is currently a placeholder readme; this repo will hold
a course covering compilers. This course is intended for undergraduate
computer science majors, however computer/electrical engineers may find
this course to be quite interesting as well.

# Directory Structure

## labs/

Contains the Labs for the course. Each lab is designed to be accomplished in
roughly a week, if taken for 1 credit. However, if the class is taken for
more than 1 credit, the instructure should add extra coursework.

The labs are meant to build the student's confidence in understanding how one
would engineer a compiler from first principles, and should able to be completed
in half a semester, as the second half of the semester is the final project.


## lecture/

Contains lecture material for the course. Currently vacant, as care needs to be
taken as to not infringe other's copyright.

Will be separated out by week.

## bib

Contains a *rough* bibliography of sources used, and can be used as a starting
point for further reading. Most sources are easy to come by, or are freely
accessible.
