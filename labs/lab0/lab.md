For this lab, we are going to get you acquainted with the development
environment that you will be using for the remainder of this course.

If you are not already familiar with UNIX/Linux/BSD, now would be a good
time to learn the basics.

Recommended Distros:

* Artix Linux
* Void Linux
* Linux Mint

All of these Linux spins have multiple desktop environments to choose from;
pick the one that best fits your workflow. You will be able to successfully
complete the course using any linux distribution, however these are chosen
because the software offered is up to date.

I personally recommend Artix Linux.

For other software to run on your chosen distro, you will need:

* C/C++ compiler
* Text Editor (Vim, Emacs, VS Code, Sublime, etc)
* lex/yacc
* A functional language of your choosing (Lisp, Scheme, PolyML, Haskell, etc)

While you certainly can run the above software on Windows, and you can complete
this course on Windows, absolutely no help will be provided or offered. You are
on your own in regards to troubleshooting and diagnosing problems.

If you do not want to nuke your Windows installation, I recommend running Linux
on a virtual machine through virtualbox. You could also use WSL.
