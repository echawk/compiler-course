## Goal

Your task for this lab is to define your own programming language.

This is meant to be a creative endeavour, so let your mind run wild
with how you represent different statements.

You will have to write your language definition in BNF.

You will also need to implement the following code problems in your new language.
They are simply to demonstrate that your programming langauge can handle describing
semi-complex algorithms.

* Ackermann's function
* Iterative fibonacci
* FizzBuzz
* ...
